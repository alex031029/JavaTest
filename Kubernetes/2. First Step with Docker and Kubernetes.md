## Understanding what happens behind the scenes

What happened when you performed the `docker run busybox echo "Hello World"` command

1. Docker checked to se if t he `busybox:latest` image was already present on your local machine.
  1. If wasn't, do Docker pulled it from the Docker Hub registry
1. Docker created a container from that image and ran the command inside it
1. The `echo` command printed the text to STDOUT and then the process terminated and the container stopped.

## Creating a Dockerfile for the image

Check the [JS example](codes/JS_Example).
