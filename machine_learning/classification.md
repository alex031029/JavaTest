1. Maximum Likelihood
	* Naive Bayessian
2. Logistic regression
	* a sigmoid function is used on linear regression model	
	* cross entrophy vs square error
	* Limitation:
		* xor
			
3. Discriminative v.s. Generative
	* Discriminative has no assumption
	* Generative has assumption: a function (e.g. Guassian) to describe the distribution
	* Discriminative usually has better performance
	* benefits of generative data:
		* less training data is needed 
		* more robust to the noise
		* prior knowledgei

4. Softmax
	* multiclass logistic regression
	* similar to probability, the sum of all classes equals to 1

5. Limitation
	* can use feature transformation
		* it looks like hidden layers in ANN
